## Creating a Repo
- You want to start by creating a repo in github, making sure to name the repo, give it a description and add a README.me file before creating.
- You then need to copy the HTTP of the file so that you can now pull the repo to your local machine.
- Now open git bash and creat a new directory using "mkdir 'directory name'"
- You now need to change to that directory unsing the comang "cd 'File name'"
- To observe that we are no in this new folder you need to now use the comand "pwd"
- Once you are in the new folder you need to use the command "git pull 'the url of the repo you created earlier '"
